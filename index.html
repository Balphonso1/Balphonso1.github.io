<p>Hi! My name is Brittany Alphonso.I was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens. I am very passionate about art. My hobbies include drawing, photography, and swimming. I also enjoy watching movies, specifically scary movies because I find them entertaining. I have two dogs a chihuahua named Chewy, and a shih Tzu named Missy. Both my parents are West Indian. My mom was born in Jamaica and my dad was born in Guyana. I have two brothers and one sister.  My major is graphic design but I still feel new to the major.  I always enjoyed drawing and painting and felt the need to expand into graphic design to broaden my skills.  I hope to learn a lot of new things and things I probably was unsure of with the process of creating websites.
